## Variables, datatypes, operators, and input-output functions in python


### Abstract
Variables, datatypes, operators, and input-output is an essential part of a python program. They provide the utmost basic forms of storing data, manipulating stored data, and also handling the input and output of the data. These concepts are leveraged on most, if not all python programs. This Labwork explains the basics of these concepts with coding assignments to help understand more about these concepts.


### Variables
Variables is used to store a single, or collection (we'll get into this later) of data on a single callable name, or variable. A variable's contents can often be modified, either with a value determined by the programmer or through an user's input.

A variable's names can be almost anything, but there are some limitations on what it can be called.
1. It cannot start with a number,
2. It cannot have an operator symbol, such as + - / * % : ; . , # @ $ &, 
3. The variable's name cannot contain a space,
4. The variable's name cannot be a reserved word, and
5. Variables are cASe SenSITive!

### Datatypes
In Python, there are a few datatypes that an user can use to their advantages. Some basic datatypes that python supports include: 
- Strings        (referred as str)
- Integers       (referred as int)
- Floating-point (referred as float)
- Date
- Complex
- Hexadecimals
- None
- List
- Tuple
- Dictionary
- Object

Datatype defines how a data is presented by a computer; characters, numbers, strings, records. Datatypes are also divided into 2 kinds:
- Basic Datatypes, and
- Special Datatypes.

#### Datatypes: Number
There are 2 common datatypes for numbers, being **float** and **integer**. Integer refers to whole numbers, meanwhile float refers to fractions. Aside from that, there are one other datatypes, which is **complex** numbers, which is a number that has a real number AND an imaginary number. Integer, float, and complex numbers are each represented in Python with the int, float, and complex classes.
